                <p>I am a fullstack software engineer specializing in Java, Springboot, Angular and AWS Cloud services. I'm passionate about learning the newest technology to improve my skillset. I graduated in 2016 at University of Houston with a Bachelor of Science. I chose this major as I have grown up playing video games and have had dreams about building my own video games. I hope to bring my new skillset to the next opportunity that I work at and innovate new and/or existing process.</p>
